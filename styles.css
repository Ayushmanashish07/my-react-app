/* <!-- parcel does hmr (hot module replacement) to reload the page automatically 
 and it takes the help of file watching algorithm written in C++ to check for changes and comands
  a reload.
  parcel is a bundler and doing works like bundling minifying and clearance of code and HMR 
  it manages dev and production build with the help of algorithm and image optimization and 
  it also does caching while devlopment to decrease build time and compresses the files compatable 
  with older version of browser (polyfills) and gives us chances of testing on https server 
  and can generates port no. to diffrent projects and uses consistent hashing algorithm to 
  bundle the things and also it does all with zero configuration. -->
  <!-- parcel is a zero configuration bundler, so you don't need to install anything.
transitive dependencies are installed automatically and you can use it to check for changes and
 perform rebuilds automatically. 
 tree shaking means removing unwanted code. --> */
